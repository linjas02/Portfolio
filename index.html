    <h3> A little About Me </h3>

    <p> After graduating high school, I found it difficult to walk the same path as my classmates heading off to the colleges of their dreams to pursue higher education.
        I felt lost for some time trying to find opportunities to advance my career and thats when I stumbled upon Thinkful's coding bootcamp. 
        Being someone who was always interested in video games, web design, and app development, joining Thinkful's curriculum was a no brainer as it presented the chance to change
        my life in a way that fit my interests. I am looking foward to meeting other developers and seeing what the future has in store for me and this community!</p>
